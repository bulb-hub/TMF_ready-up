# TMF ReadyUp
A TrackMania (Nations/United) Forever server (XASECO) plugin which prints podium-ready players in chat.

In most TrackMania games, pressing `DEL` on the end-race (podium, ie. "chat time") screen puts you in a podium-ready state - once all players are podium-ready, the end-race screen gets skipped, immediately starting the next race. Spectators are not counted towards this check, thus they are technically always considered to be podium-ready. TrackMania Sunrise, for example, had an indicator for podium-ready players next to each of their names on the scoreboard during the end screen, but TrackMania Forever does not.
